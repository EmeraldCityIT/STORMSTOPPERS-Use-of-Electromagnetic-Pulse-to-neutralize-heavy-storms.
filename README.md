# STORMSTOPPERS-Use-of-Electromagnetic-Pulse-to-nutralize-heavy-storms.
High pressure storms are caused by winds in the troposphere driven by electromagnetic fields. Atmospheric fields are able to induce hurricanes, electrical storms and winds which are able to drive lethal waves into coastal populations. In theory, the use of Electromagnetic weaponry during beginning or active stages of a storm would neutralize fields which are driving winds and creating hazardous conditions. The goal would be in recognizing conditions which cause dangerous storm activity and neutralize areas at the beginning stages of a storm. Testing should be done far away from population centers.
